# PyTorch Learning Journey 

Welcome to my PyTorch learning repository! This project documents my journey as I learn PyTorch from **basic to advanced** using the excellent [PyTorch Tutorial for Deep Learning (Basics to Advanced)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvboy8bmDCjwNHgTaYH2puK7) playlist on YouTube by *Krish Naik*.

Each folder or script in this repository corresponds to one or more videos from the playlist.


## Topics Covered

- PyTorch basics: tensors, autograd, datasets, and dataloaders
- Neural networks in PyTorch
- Model training loops
- Optimizers and loss functions
- CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
- Transfer learning
- Custom datasets and transforms
- Saving/loading models
- And more advanced PyTorch features...


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Google Colab (optional)


## Note

This repository is for my personal learning and project practice. New Notebooks will be added as I learn more.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and connect if you're interested in collaboration or feedback. Let's grow together in the world of Data Science!
